The subject is based on the data contained in the file https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/554590ab-ae62-40ac-8353-ee75162c05ee, which you are asked to download (in the same folder as this notebook).the aim of the APP is to provide algorithms allowing to sort the communes of France according to certain criteria. The data are in .csv (comma separated values) format. You have to import these data in a python script named√©numero_groupe_APP1.pyYou have to implement algorithms to sort the communes of France by increasing order of distance to a given city. The goal is to propose the fastest algorithm possible. The implementation you will propose must not use either the sorted or the sort function. Your program will also give the following statistics: min (closest city to the city passed in parameter), first quartile, median, max. The implementation of a function giving the order quantile could be useful (reminder: the median is the quantile of order 12, for example).when the reference city is the first district of Paris, a possible (but not obligatory) output is: min: 0. 82 km for PARIS 02 (75002)first quartile : 187.15 km for PONT SUR SAMBRE (59138)median : 318.88 km for BELLEFONTAINE (88370)third quartile : 459.81 km for QUEYSSAC (24140)max : 9422.32 km for ST PHILIPPE (97442)You will be confronted with choices. Do not hesitate to explore the data with a spreadsheet.
