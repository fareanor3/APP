# APP
Problem-Based Learning

This repository accumulates the different APP (learning by problems) of ESME SUDRIA in SUP.
These APP want to sweep a vast panel of problem in Algorithmics thanks to the base of python learned during the semester 1. 
It is also a means to make us work in group and learn to give us roles and to hold us there for the good functioning of the project of group.
