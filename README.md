Programming an educational deck of cards

How does the programming of card games become child's play using adapted data structures?

You are a team of young engineers and you work in the programming of educational tablet games for children. 
You are asked to program a card game based on one of the very first games we all learned as children: the famous game of "the battle" and for which you are asked to add some variations. These variants will aim to deepen the notions of calculation and comparison in young children. This game is usually played with 52 cards in four suits (clover, diamonds, hearts and spades) with 13 cards per suit. The cards are compared with each other by their numerical value according to the following rule: the order of the cards follows the bridge hierarchy: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, ten... up to two (1 > King > Queen > Jack > 10 >⋯> 3 > 2). 
Thus the Ace of hearts wins over the 3 of clubs, ... etc. At the start of the game, each of the two opponents receives a deck of 26 cards and, in each round, the opponents turn the card over their deck and compare their two turned cards. If opponent A's card cA is stronger than that of opponent B(cB): opponent A takes both cards and adds them underneath his deck, starting with cA, then cB. If cB is the stronger: B adds underneath his deck, first cB, then cA. In case of a tie, there will be a battle: A and B each put the next card and put it face down on the previous card (no comparison). Then they draw a second card, this time face up, and it is this card that will decide the winner. At the next non-zero comparison, the winner takes all the cards, his pile first, then the loser's, and puts them underneath his deck. The game stops (eventually) when one of the two players has all the cards. You are asked to give the user the choice to choose either a 26 duel game, which at the end displays the score of each of the two opponents, or a game that continues until one opponent is completely defeated. In other words, a game that continues until one of the packs is empty. 
In the first variant of the game, called "open battle", you are asked to change the rule in case of a battle by placing the next card directly face up without going through the face down. The highest card wins. 
The second variant of the game is called "Battle for Two": it is only played with cards containing only numbers from 1 to 9, removing the figures and the 10 from the traditional deck of cards. Each of the two opponents in turn knocks down two cards. The two cards are placed next to each other to make up the largest number. For example: 1 and 9, can be 19 or 91. The opposing player does the same and the higher number wins. 
For the third variation of the game, called "the battle of addition", you will use the same principle as in the second variation, where each opponent plays two cards, but for this variation, the points of the two cards are added together instead of placing them side by side. For example 9 and 1 gives 10. Likewise, the 5 and the 5, will also give 10, so there will be a battle. Your mission is therefore to find an algorithm that automatically makes the classic card game in addition to these three variants. The whole team will have to certify that this algorithm works correctly. In other words, you must be able to justify or even demonstrate the proper functioning of your algorithm for any randomly drawn configuration. Finally, you must also show, by means of a Python simulation with console mode visualization, the feasibility of your algorithm.

Learning objectives of the AAV: 
At the end of the "RETURN" session of this AAV, each student should be able to : 
Express an algorithm using an abstract machine of the File and Stack type.
Translate an abstract machine of type File and stack into Python.
Establish a program validating the respect of the axioms of an abstract machine of type File and of type Stack written in Python.justify the correct operation of the algorithm made up of an abstract machine of type File and of type Stack.
To test the correct operation of the algorithm made up of an abstract machine of type File and of type Stack.
Create a programme to visualise in console mode the progress of the operation of an abstract machine of type File and of type Battery.
Modify the axioms and adapt the operators accordingly as well as the program validating them. Use the notion of set as a data structure.
Divide roles and tasks within the APP.
